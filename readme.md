# TO DO app

## Instructions
The objective is to build a basic TO-DO list application.

Users are identified by email

Users login by authenticating with their email address and password

Users may create as many separate lists as they want

Lists must have a name/title

Lists may have a description but it is optional

Lists can be created without adding items (e.g. a user can create an empty list to use later)

Lists can contain many items (with no limit)

List items should have a title, a state (not started, in progress, complete), and an optional note/description
